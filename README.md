Git-Streak-Savor
================
This is a script to help you keep streak on github.

Input the path of your working directory to be monitored, if you don't have any modification to those directory, Git-Streak-Savor will create a commit for you to make up the streak.

Create a Cron job run every day on 11:55PM to run this script.
